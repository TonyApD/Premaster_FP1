\section*{Exercise 1}
The exercise code can be found in Question1.lhs\\
If both (folding and Exercise 3.2) recursion schemes are applicable, 
which one is preferable in terms of running time?\\
I don't think that there is any difference, both functions perform the same operations,
It could be the compiler does somthing smart with them. But folding against the 
recursion scheme form exercise 3.2 does not make a difference.

This looks hard...
